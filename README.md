# SecureNet: Cybersecurity Toolkit

SecureNet is a comprehensive cybersecurity toolkit designed to analyze network traffic using machine learning-based anomaly detection algorithms.

## Features
- Preprocessing module for data cleaning and feature engineering
- Machine learning model implementation for anomaly detection
- Training script to train the machine learning model
- Evaluation script to evaluate the model's performance
- Prediction script to make predictions on new network traffic data
- Visualization module for displaying analysis results
